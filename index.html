    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Good morning, afternoon or goodnight. Wherever you may be reading this, welcome to my first personal webpage!!! My
        name as stated above is Ryan Swartz. I'm 28 years old born and raised in Kansas, unfortunately I do not know Dorthy
        or Toto. I graduated from Kansas University with a bachelors in Economics in 2013. Over the past 5 years I have been
        working in Edgerton, KS at the BNSF Logistics Park Kansas City. It's a state of the art intermodal facility spanning
        400 acres with inital investments of 300$ million. During my tenure at LPKC I had the opportunity to work from the
        ground up, literally. I started off as a groundmen, followed by terminal operator, operations manager, senior operations
        manager, assistant terminal manager and lastly terminal manager. The railroad takes a unquie approach for all employee's
        by having them start at the ground level regardless of previous experience or degree's. I couldn't have been more
        thankful as it taught me invaluable lessons I don't believe I would have gotten any other way. It also had a unquie
        blend of desk time and yard time, allowing you to get to truly know your coworkers. To conclude it was an amazing 5
        years but I always felt there was something else out there for me.

        If you can't tell I still have a passion for what I use to do for a living. However coding has always been more than
        a hobby. It's something I would do after a 60+ hour week on the railroad. Its something I would find myself doing in college
        instead of Economics homework at times. It's something I have a true passion for and its what brought me to Chicago for this 
        class and future opportunities field. I couldn't be more excited and ready to start this next chapter. So once again 
        thanks for visiting my webpage, wish me luck & here goes nothing!
